## 3:25:45 PM
The log captures a series of updates to an official website for "Anthu In Tech," all occurring on December 26, 2025, between 2:33 PM and 2:59 PM. The changes primarily involve HTML files, suggesting content creation, page structuring, and integration of common UI elements.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`aboutUs.html` (multiple timestamps, 2:33:34 PM to 2:59:36 PM):**
    *   Initial version (2:33:34 PM) established a comprehensive "About Us" page detailing the company's mission, vision, story, approach, leadership, and contact information. It included a placeholder note for future content in "Our Story".
    *   Subsequent, minor edits through various timestamps (2:57:02 PM, 2:57:34 PM, 2:57:57 PM, 2:58:54 PM, 2:59:04 PM, 2:59:36 PM) iteratively refined the "Our Story" section, specifically updating a sentence about the company creating its website and adding a link to `www.anthuintech.com`, culminating in the phrase "Anthu In Tech has so far create its own website [anthuintech.com] and more are to come."
    *   This page consistently loads external JavaScript libraries for charting (`Chart.js`), 3D graphics (`Three.js`, `three-globe`), and data visualization (`D3.js`).

*   **`bookMeeting.html` (12/26/2025, 2:33:46 PM):**

*   **`companyprofile.html` (12/26/2025, 2:34:26 PM):**
    *   Detailed the company's profile, including an executive summary, history (founded 2025 in Lilongwe, Malawi), management message, mission (highlighting "Pro bono publico"), vision (to be the best local software development company in 5 years), core values, products/services, and contact information.
    *   Like `aboutUs.html`, this page also includes `Chart.js`, `Three.js`, `three-globe`, and `D3.js`.

*   **`contactus.html` (12/26/2025, 2:34:41 PM):**
    *   Features contact information, a direct link to the `bookMeeting.html` page, social media links for the company, and a form for sending messages.

*   **`index.html` (12/26/2025, 2:35:45 PM):**
    *   The main landing page, showcasing Anthu In Tech's core values, mission, vision, software & web solutions, and database solutions.
    *   Includes a prominent section on "Africa Internet Penetration" with statistics from Statista, implying a focus on regional context.
    *   Features a "Microsoft Excel Courses" section and an embedded Spotify player for "The Political Circuit" podcast.
    *   Contains a "YOU'RE IN GOOD TECH COMPANY" section with a brand marquee and a "Book a Meeting" call to action.
    *   Similar to `aboutUs.html` and `companyprofile.html`, it loads `Chart.js`, `Three.js`, `three-globe`, and `D3.js`.

*   **`loginpage.html` (12/26/2025, 2:35:57 PM):**
    *   A simple login form for staff with fields for email and password, and links for "Log In" (to `Dashboard.html`) and "Sign up".

*   **`ms-excel.html` (12/26/2025, 2:36:20 PM):**
    *   Displays a grid of Microsoft Excel courses, categorized into "Free Trial" (e.g., "Excel Basics 101") and "Locked" courses with tiered pricing in MWK (e.g., "Excel for Finance" at MWK 250,000).
    *   Includes dummy modals indicating "Purchase system coming soon" and "Trial Activated - Lessons coming soon."

*   **`databaseSolution.html` (12/26/2025, 2:39:15 PM):**
    *   This page appears to be a placeholder, containing the standard header, navigation, and footer, but lacking specific unique content in the main body related to database solutions.

*   **`news&updates.html` (multiple timestamps, 2:39:37 PM to 2:39:49 PM):**
    *   Features a navigation bar for different content types (Articles, News & Announcements, Insights, Jobs, Data).
    *   Includes a "CEO Section" prominently featuring Lacson Imran, his mission statement, and personal contact/social media links (website, phone, email, LinkedIn, Facebook, GitHub). The content remains consistent across its multiple saves.

*   **`ourteam.html` (12/26/2025, 2:39:59 PM):**
    *   Currently, this page focuses entirely on the "CEO Section" (identical to the one in `news&updates.html`), showcasing Lacson Imran as the Founder and CEO.

*   **`purchases.html` (12/26/2025, 2:40:12 PM):**
    *   A course viewing page, featuring a video player with a downloadable video (`excel-t1.mkv`) and a list of course topics.
    *   Notably, this page also replicates the entire "courses-grid" section from `ms-excel.html`, suggesting it serves both as a course content viewer and a course catalog.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Site Structure:** All HTML files share a common header (logo, company name, tagline "Technology for Change. Knowledge for All."), topbar (search, support, sales contact, language selector), main navigation links, and a multi-column footer.
*   **Global Contact Information:** The email `anthuintech@gmail.com` and phone numbers `+265882000119` (sales) and `+265995793164` (general contact) are consistently present across pages.
*   **Payment Integration:** Every page includes an identical "coffee payment" section at the bottom, offering cryptocurrency (USDT with a specific QR code and wallet address `TFc14YRx83CVWuWykfxnbNmxkyGsBtgJj7`) and a multi-tab popup for various payment methods (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Mobile Money). This payment functionality is implemented with identical inline JavaScript across all files.
*   **External Library Usage:** `style.css` and `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css` are linked in all HTML files for consistent styling and icons. However, `Chart.js`, `Three.js`, `three-globe`, and `D3.js` are specifically loaded only on `aboutUs.html`, `companyprofile.html`, and `index.html`, indicating these pages might feature interactive data or graphical elements.
*   **Redundant Content:** The "CEO Section" featuring Lacson Imran is duplicated across `news&updates.html` and `ourteam.html`. Similarly, the Excel course grid is present on both `ms-excel.html` and `purchases.html`. This suggests potential for componentization or that these pages are in early development stages.
*   **Future-Oriented Content:** Mentions like "This section can later include dates, key milestones..." in `aboutUs.html` and "Purchase system coming soon." in `ms-excel.html` and `purchases.html` indicate that some features and content are still under development or planned for future expansion.
*   **Geographic Focus:** The company is based in Lilongwe, Malawi, and the `index.html` page's "Africa Internet Penetration" section highlights a regional focus.
